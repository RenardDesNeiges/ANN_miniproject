    "# Miniproject: Image Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the oldest traditions in deep learning is to first tackle the fun problem of MNIST classification. [The MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used as a first test for new classification algorithms. \n",
    "We follow this tradition to investigate the performance of artificial neural networks of different complexity on MNIST. However, since MNIST is too easy for accessing the full power of modern machine learning algorithms (see e.g. [this post](https://twitter.com/goodfellow_ian/status/852591106655043584)) we will extend our analysis to the recently introduced, harder [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should have a running installation of [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) and [keras](https://keras.io/). Feel free to gain inspiration from the [Keras example directory](https://keras.io/examples/) for your implementations.\n",
    "- You should know the concepts \"multilayer perceptron\", \"stochastic gradient descent with minibatches\", \"Adam\", \"convolutional neural network\", \"training and validation data\", \"overfitting\", \"regularization\", and \"early stopping\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will learn how to define feedforward neural networks in keras and fit them to data (i.e. training).\n",
    "- You will be guided through a prototyping procedure for the application of deep learning to a specific domain.\n",
    "- You will gain some experience on the influence of network architecture, optimizer and regularization choices on the goodness of fit.\n",
    "- You will learn to be more patient :) Some fits may take your computer quite a bit of time; run them over night (or on an external server).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation is (mostly) based on the figures you submit and your answer sentences. Provide clear and concise answers respecting the indicated maximum length.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The submitted notebook must be run by you!** We will only do random tests of your code and not re-run the full notebook. There will be fraud detection sessions at the end of the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your names\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before you start**: please enter your full name(s) in the field below."
